# Screenshot Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for capturing and preparing screenshots for the portfolio website.

## Capturing Screenshots

### Tools

- **GoFullPage (Chrome Extension)**: For full-page screenshots of web applications
- **DevTools Device Mode**: For capturing responsive views at specific dimensions
- **SnagIt or ShareX**: For capturing specific UI elements with annotations

### Resolutions

Use consistent resolutions for screenshots:
- Desktop: 1200x800px or 1440x900px
- Mobile: 375x667px (iPhone 8) or 390x844px (iPhone 12)
- Tablet: 768x1024px (iPad)

### Setup

1. Ensure the application is running in a clean environment
2. Remove browser toolbars, extensions, and personal information
3. Use a clean, professional browser theme
4. Set up the application with sample data that showcases its features

## Creating Mockups

### Tools

- **Canva**: Free mockup templates for placing screenshots in device frames
- **Figma**: Community templates for device mockups
- **SmartMockups**: Online tool for creating realistic device mockups

### Process

1. Capture the raw screenshot at the appropriate resolution
2. Import the screenshot into your mockup tool
3. Apply a device frame (laptop, phone, tablet)
4. Export as WebP format at high quality
5. Compress if necessary to keep file size under 200KB

## Optimization

### Tools

- **Squoosh**: Browser-based image optimization tool
- **TinyPNG/TinyJPG**: Simple compression tool
- **ImageOptim**: Desktop app for Mac users
- **WebP Converter**: For converting to WebP format

### Process

1. Convert images to WebP format for best compression/quality ratio
2. Resize images to the appropriate dimensions
3. Compress images to reduce file size
4. Verify quality after compression

## Naming Convention

Use a consistent naming convention for all screenshots:

```
project-name-feature-device.webp
```

Examples:
- `bill-gen-main.webp` - Main screenshot of Bill Gen project
- `general-pulse-terminal.webp` - Terminal view of General Pulse
- `quotation-gen-mobile.webp` - Mobile view of Quotation Generator

## Best Practices

- Capture multiple views of each project (dashboard, features, mobile)
- Include both light and dark mode if applicable
- Show real-world usage scenarios with realistic data
- Highlight key features that demonstrate your technical skills
- Ensure text is readable in the final images
